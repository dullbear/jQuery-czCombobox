{"body":"czCombobox jQuery plugin\r\n===\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n---\r\n\r\nczCombobox is a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) plugin that allows you to turn default browser dropdown list into much more attractive.\r\n    \r\nThe plugin is usable not only for end users, but also for developers. czCombobox has a lot of configuration options so you can modify its behaviour and appearance. From this version the core CSS file is separated from the CSS that provides drop download list appearance, and now you are able to easily create new skins for the plugin.\r\n    \r\nExamples\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease view demo page to see the possibilities of *czCombobox*.\r\n    \r\nInstallation\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease follow these instructions to install czCombobox:\r\n\r\nDownload and unpack the archive.\r\nInclude jQuery and plugin files to your web page:\r\n\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/jquery-1.4.2.min.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/js/jquery.czCombobox.js\"></script>\r\n\t\r\n\r\nInclude core or your skin CSS files to your page:\r\n\r\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"images/style.css\" />\r\n\t<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"images/skin_name.css\" />\r\n\t\r\nDone! Now make your dropdown lists look and behave sexy!\r\n\t\r\n\t$('#country-1').czCombobox({\r\n        className : 'light-black',\r\n        listMargin: 5,\r\n        changeCallback: function() {\r\n            alert('Has Changed')\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n         \r\nUsage and configuration options\r\n---\r\n\r\n*czCombobox* has a number of configuration options that are passed to the plugin in the form of JavaScript object.\r\nThe full list of options is:   \r\n\r\n**className** *String, Default: null*  \r\nThe class name of dropdown list wrap.  \r\n**initCallback** *Funtion, Default: null*  \r\nfunction that is called at the end of constrictor.  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn this version I have separated core CSS and presentational CSS, so now it's possible to create new skins for *czCombobox*. The download package contains one example skin.
